The present system of allocating resources of the Polkadot Ubiquitous Computer (parachain slot auctions) is based on a model of one-core-per-parachain: this is a legacy interpretation of the Polkadot platform and is not a reflection of its present capabilities. With Polkadot's capability to adapt to its users'need, a new paradign for allocating coretime is being implemented by ecosystem teams. Coretime on the Polkadot UC is envisioned to be sold by the Polkadot System in two separate formats: Bulk Coretime and Instantaneous Coretime. When a Polkadot Core is utilized, we say it is dedicated to a \"Task\" rather than a \"parachain\". The Task to which a Core is dedicated may change at every Relay-chain block and while one predominant type of Task is to secure a Cumulus-based blockchain (i.e. a parachain), other types of Tasks are envisioned. Bulk Coretime is sold periodically on a specialised system chain known as the \"Coretime-chain\" and allocated in advance of its usage, whereas Instantaneous Coretime is sold on the Relay-chain immediately prior to usage on a block-by-block basis.\r\n\r\nThis talk aims to explain this paradigm change within the Polkadot community to adapt to end-user needs, provide more agility and reduce long-term design flows.", "description": "<tags>Polkadot</tags>", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 172, "code": "WBQUWB", "public_name": "Gavin Wood", "biography": "-", "answers": []}], "links": [], "attachments": [], "answers": []}, {"id": 55, "guid": "9d055f5d-0a23-55b1-b2f0-c0edd3a89321", "logo": "/media/protocol-berg/submissions/PZ37T7/CleanShot_2023-05-25_at_03.52.022x_X9fVsKB.png", "date": "2023-09-15T15:30:00+02:00", "start": "15:30", "duration": "00:50", "room": "Magazin - Main Stage", "slug": "protocol-berg-55-interplanetary-consensus-scaling-the-open-data-economy", "url": "https://speak.protocol.berlin/protocol-berg/talk/PZ37T7/", "title": "InterPlanetary Consensus: Scaling the open data economy", "subtitle": "", "track": "Consensus", "type": "Presentation: Keynote", "language": "en", "abstract": "Consensus poses a major scalability bottleneck in blockchain networks - hampering web-scale applications like Twitch, Twitter, Tiktok, or web3 alternatives to scale within web3.

The algorithm is well-documented and open source. This ensures that the process is permissionlessly reproducible. The result of this indexing is stored as a collection of chunks.\r\n\r\nBy building chunks (\"a time-ordered log of an index of a time-ordered log\"), fronting the chunks with Bloom filters, and maintaining a manifest of all chunks and Blooms, we create an off-chain index that lives naturally on content-address stores such as IPFS. We publish the hashes of all parts of the index to a smart contract.\r\n\r\nEnd users (by querying the Bloom filters via the smart contract) may download only that portion of the index that they are interested in (i.e., their own histories). This ensures that the system works on small machines. Using \"Pin by Default\" the system realizes the massive benefit of enlisting end users in the distribution of the chunks. Heavy users acquire, pin, and distribute a larger portion of the index than light users making the system \"naturally fair.\"\r\n\r\nAnd--because we've purposefully enlisted end-users in carrying the burden of the data, the cost of operation is near zero. Everyone shares the burden and reaps the benefits.\r\n\r\nWe're trying to build a true public good, and we wish the system to be sustainable.

Concurrent transaction execution is a promising technique to accelerate transaction processing and increase the overall throughput. Existing concurrency control algorithms, however, fail to obtain enough speedups in real-world blockchains due to the high-contention workloads.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will propose a novel operation-level concurrency control algorithm designed for blockchains.\r\nThe core idea behind our algorithm is that only operations depending on conflicts should be executed serially, while all other conflict-free operations can be executed concurrently. Therefore, in contrast to the traditional approaches, which block or abort the entire transaction when encountering conflicts, our algorithm introduces a redo phase to resolve conflicts at the operation level by re-executing conflicting operations only. We also develop a set of data dependency tracking mechanisms to achieve precise identification and speedy re-execution for conflicting operations. We implement a prototype named ParallelEVM based on Go Ethereum and evaluate ParallelEVM using real-world Ethereum blocks. The evaluation results show that ParallelEVM achieves an average speedup of 4.28\u00d7.
